# inventory-application

This is a project of [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://theodinproject.com),
I did it to learn more about Express, Pug, Heroku and Mongoose. And along the
way I learned Sass.

In this Inventory App you can create categories that have items. And create items
that belong a category, I implemented all CRUD functions, Create, Read, Update
and Delete, so items and categories can do that.

I also learn and practiced the MVC(Model, View, Controller) pattern.
